Broadcom BCM4401 OS/2 NDIS 2.0.1 MAC driver 1.05
================================================

1.Introduction

Broadcom BCM4401 is a fast ethernet MAC chip.

The official driver is not available for OS/2, 
and the datasheet is not available to write drivers.

This driver is based on the source of Linux driver version 3.0.7, 
which was provided on the Broadcom website. 


Included files are:
b44a.os2	NDIS 2.0.1 MAC driver
b44a.nif	Network Information File
b44a.sym	Symbol Map file
b44a.lnk	Document (this file)
source.zip	source files
LICENSE		GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

You could download the latest file on the gomi:NDIS MAC Drivers page,

2.No Warranty

This code is provided 'AS IS' and any warranties are disclaimed.


3.Functional restrictions

- Wake-on-LAN is not supported.


4.Considerable configuration keywords

[TXEARLY]
The value of this keyword is written directly into txwatermark register.
You should NOT specify larger than the default value, 56(0x38).

[TXMXDMA]
The value of this keyword is written directly into emactxmaxburstlen register.
This register should be 2^n, and be equal to or smaller than 64(0x40),
though the register can be modified in range of [0..511].
The driver allows one among 8, 16, 32, 64.


5.Note

- No test on SMP environment. (I gess it can work.)
- If the error recovery reset occurs, rx frames queued by protocol 
   may corrupt... though I don't know such excellent protocol that 
   can do rx frames asynchronous copy.
- Hang-up ver.1.02 with the chip rev.2 may result from the same 
  reason at the different point that is fixed at linux v3.0.10.


6.Redistribution with modification

This is GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE polluted software.
You should not diffuse pollution... 


7.Acknowledgement

Yuri Dario tried many test codes to detect and to resolve 
the problem that ver.1.02 driver freezes with the chip rev.02.
